This repository consists of a collection of some of my web-based projects.

tennis
------
- This one is an interactive visualization (and some animation too). It identifies how the big 3 in tennis (Federer, Nadal and Djokovic) have progressed through tournaments from 2004-2014
- This is just simply done using D3.js. The required data is stored as a csv file.

yelp-foodie
-----------
- Yelp Foodie is a Visual Recommender. It recommends restaurants based on user interest.
- The user is first asked to provide 3 of his/her interests.
- After that, the user can just choose a location, one (or more) cuisines and look at recommended places plotted on a venn diagram
- This project is done using D3.js for frontend and Python, Heroku and MongoLab for backend.
- The dataset used for this project was provided by [Yelp] (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge).
- [This] (https://github.com/tejasvigangaiah/DataViz) repository contains the full code (including server implementation and data analysis)

interactive-viz-learn
---------------------
- This is just a simple interactive visualization using 3 csv files.
- It is not the best implementation. I was just learning how to use D3.js.
